# LunarHacks22 IngredientSafe project

Packaged food, medication, make-up, what do they have in common? Tiny but important ingredient labels. We created an interactive scanner to keep the aging and visually impaired safe from allergens.

**About the project**
Ingredientsafe is an ingredient scanner that scans for a userâ€™s allergies or other dietary restrictions. The webpage was coded in HTML and CSS while the back end and logic portion was code in Python. We ran into many challenges with the back end due to the difficulty of implementing an image-to-text scanner. We encountered many errors with the various methods we found online, however we were able to figure it out in the end. Another challenge was the integration of the front-end portion and the back-end due to limitations on the coding environments and tools that we had access to, however we are confident that this can be done given enough time and resources. We are very proud of how we were able to scan an image for text and extract information from it, as we originally believed it to be too far out of our reach. This experience taught us a lot, but the main takeaway we got from this was to not give up when faced with error after error in our code. Our next steps in this project include integrating our front-end and back-end, as well as expanding our application to work as a mobile app to eliminate the need to upload an image to a website.
