# LunarHacks22 IngredientSafe project

Packaged food, medication, make-up, what do they have in common? Tiny but important ingredient labels. We created an interactive scanner to keep the aging and visually impaired safe from allergens.

**About the project**

Ingredientsafe is an ingredient scanner that scans for a user’s allergies or other dietary restrictions. The webpage was coded in HTML and CSS while the back end and logic portion was coded in Python.
